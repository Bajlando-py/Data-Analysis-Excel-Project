### Overview
In this project I created *Bike Sales Dashboard* from data in Excel file.   

First I created *working sheet* where I copied all raw data. In this sheet I did all data tweaking and cleaning. I removed duplicates, I replaced marital status and gender from just letters to full description like male, married and so on to make data more clear and I created formula with 4 IFs statements to consolidate wide range of ages to 4 age brackets.
