### Overview
In this project I created *Bike Sales Dashboard* from data in Excel file.   

**First** I created *Working Sheet* where I copied all raw data. In this sheet I did all data tweaking and cleaning. I removed duplicates, I replaced marital status and gender from just letters to full description like male, married and so on to make data more clear and I created formula with 4 IFs statements to consolidate wide range of ages to 4 age brackets.   

**Second** I created *Pivot Table* sheet where I created all pivot tables needed for dashboard.  

**Third** I created *Dashboard* sheet and copied created pivot tables there. In the dashboard I organized graphs the way that you can see Average income vs purchase a bike, how commuting distance affect buying a bike and how customer age affect buying a bike. I consider to do age brackets little smaller (like age span of 10 years), but I had decided it is enough for demonstration purposes. And finally I added few slicers where you can filter all graphs by marital status, region and education.  

I was thinking to place the dashboard here but if it is converted to web page it losses the functionality. You can go to [Project_Excel_Branch](https://github.com/Bajlando-py/Data-Analysis-Excel-Projects/tree/Project_1_Excel) and open the folder **Project-1 Excel** or go straight to [Excel file](https://github.com/Bajlando-py/Data-Analysis-Excel-Projects/blob/Project_1_Excel/Project-1%20Excel/Project-1%20Excel%20Dataset.xlsx) and download it.
